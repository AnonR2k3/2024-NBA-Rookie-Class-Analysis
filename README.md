# 2024-NBA-Rookie-Class-Analysis
**Executive Summary**
The 2024 NBA Rookie Class was touted by sports media as among the weakest ever in the league with no players from that class striking headlines to this day. To determine if this class truly was as weak as reported or just misunderstood, I analysed the lottery picks of 6 draft classes throughout 25 years. 3 of these were historically weak draft classes (2000, 2013, and 2024) and the other 3 were the draft classes exactly the year before as a control. I utilised Hollinger's Game Score to evaluate the class' performance throughout their first 2 seasons. 
What I found was the 2024 class averaged a Game Score of 6.8 against the league average of 10.1, the highest difference among the weak classes. There can be many factors that influenced this ranging from simply lack of talent to the higher demands of the NBA for pace and shooting. 

**Chart 1: Raw Efficiency Trends**
Analyses the average Game Score of the first 14 picks of the weakest draft classes in modern NBA history. The class averages increased as the years progressed however this is likely a false positive linked to the dead ball era of the early 2000s and the fast paced offense in the NBA of the 2020s.

**Chart 2**
Analyses where each pick's Game Score averages stand commpared to the league average and organized performance by colour. All of these classes hold either 2 or 3 players that perform slighlty above league average.

**Chart 3**
Taking into account evolving offenses in the NBA, I created a visual that displays both the class average and league average to determine how each class holds in their respective eras. To compare, I added the same visualizations for the draft classes immediately preceding the weak classes. This proves that rookies can contribute immediately and these classes just lack the talent to do so.
